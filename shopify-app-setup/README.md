# Sticky Cart Drawer - Shopify App Setup

This directory contains the Shopify app setup for the Sticky Cart Drawer.

## Architecture

The app uses an **App Proxy** approach instead of theme extension embeds for better compatibility and control:

### App Proxy Configuration
- **Proxy URL**: `https://sticky-cart-flow.vercel.app/proxy`
- **Subpath**: `cart-drawer` 
- **Prefix**: `tools`

This makes the cart drawer accessible at: `https://[shop].myshopify.com/tools/cart-drawer/`

### Routes
- `/proxy/settings` - Returns cart drawer settings from Supabase
- `/proxy/script` - Serves the cart-drawer.js file with shop domain injected

### Theme Extension
A minimal theme extension (`sticky-cart-minimal`) provides a simple loader that:
1. Loads the cart drawer script from the app proxy
2. Only runs on storefront (not theme editor)
3. Handles errors gracefully

### Benefits
- No theme dependency issues
- Dynamic script serving with shop context
- Easy updates without theme modifications
- Better error handling and debugging
- Reduced conflicts with other apps

## Quick Start

### 1. Create New Shopify App Project
```bash
# Create new Shopify app using CLI
npm create @shopify/app@latest sticky-cart-drawer-app

# Choose these options:
# - Framework: Remix
# - Language: TypeScript  
# - Template: Start with Remix (recommended)
# - Package manager: npm
```

### 2. Replace Generated Files
After creating the app, replace these files with the ones from this setup directory:

- Copy `shopify.app.toml` to project root
- Copy `app/` directory contents to your app directory
- Copy `extensions/` directory to project root
- Copy `prisma/schema.prisma` to project root
- Copy `.env.example` and create your `.env` file

### 3. Install and Configure

```bash
cd sticky-cart-drawer-app
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your actual Shopify credentials

# Initialize database
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push

# Link to your Partner Dashboard app
shopify app config link

# Start development
npm run dev
```
